### Actual Runtime Implementation ###

This folder contains runtime logic for render pipeline

For a data-driven renderer,  this part should at least contains

1. resouce generator (load data at runtime and generate actual render resouces (defined within /Resouce))
2. shader library (our shader library for user) and shader compiler
3. actual dispatch logic, job management (not sure if I understand it right)
